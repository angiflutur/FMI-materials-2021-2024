# CS112 (LFA)
# Projects Lab 1 (February 2022)

In this lab, we will be working on two exercises focused on Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA). 

## Exercise 1: DFA Parser Engine

Implement a library/program in a programming language of your choosing to load and validate a DFA input file of the format presented in the Appendix.

### Files:
- `dfa_parser_engine.py`
- `dfa_config_file`

## Exercise 2: DFA Acceptance Engine 

Implement a library/program in a programming language of your choosing to test the acceptance of a DFA loaded from a DFA config file.

### Files:
- `dfa_acceptance_engine.py`
- `dfa_config_file`
- `<word_to_test>` (Replace with the word you want to test)


# Projects Lab 2 (March 2022)

This lab builds on the concepts introduced in Lab 1, focusing on Non-deterministic Finite Automata (NFA).

## Exercise 1: NFA Parser Engine

Extend the library/program you implemented in L1.Ex1 to load and validate an NFA input file of the format presented in the Appendix.

### Files:
- `nfa_parser_engine.py`
- `nfa_config_file`

## Exercise 2: NFA Acceptance Engine 

Implement a library/program in a programming language of your choosing to test the acceptance of an NFA loaded from an NFA config file.

### Files:
- `nfa_acceptance_engine.py`
- `nfa_config_file`
- `<wordtotest>` (Replace with the word you want to test)

## Exercise 3: NFA to DFA Conversion Engine 

Implement a library/program in a programming language of your choosing to convert an NFA loaded from an NFA config file to a DFA.

### Files:
- `nfa_conversion_engine.py`
- `nfa_config_file`

## Exercise 4: ε-NFA Acceptance Engine

Implement a library/program in a programming language of your choosing to test the acceptance of an ε-NFA.

### Files:
- `e_nfa_acceptance_engine.py`
- `e_nfa_config_file`
- `<wordtotest>` (Replace with the word you want to test)

# Projects Lab 3 (March 2022)

Welcome to Projects Lab 3! In this lab, you will explore DFA minimization using the Myhill-Nerode theorem. Follow the instructions below to complete the exercises.

## Exercise 1: DFA Minimization Engine 

Implement a library/program in a programming language of your choosing to simulate the Myhill-Nerode theorem and minimize a DFA to the smallest DFA with the same level of completeness.

### Files:
- `dfa_minimization_engine.py`
- `dfa_config_file`

## Exercise 2: Advanced DFA Minimization Engine 

Implement a library/program in a programming language of your choosing to minimize a DFA to the smallest (potentially) incomplete DFA.

### Files:
- `adv_dfa_minimization_engine.py`
- `dfa_config_file`
